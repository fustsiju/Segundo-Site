        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I've been studying programming since 2017 at IFSULDEMINAS, but didn't was there where my interest in
            computing came from. Since i was a kid i always liked try to understand the why of things, one of those
            things that intrigued was my video game, "How does it work?". I asked myself every day. As time passed, i
            had the opportunity to delve deeper into computing and, even though it's just the beginning, i already felt
            pleasure in thinking about the possibilities of programming.</p>
        <p>I'm a very competitive person, not in the bad sense of the word, i just like of a challenge, something that
            makes me try to be better. For example, lately i have been studying from a website called CSS Battle where,
            based on the number of characters that were used for solving an exercise in CSS3, you get more or less
            points. On this same site there is a ranking of over 200,000 players. I'm currently one of the top 200 and
            i'm still not satisfied.</p>
