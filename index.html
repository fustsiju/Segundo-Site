        <h1>About me</h1>
        
        <p style="align: justify;">I discovered my love for technology as a child, I always asked how televisions worked and even how a lamp could light up a hallway. 
            When I had my first computer, at the age of 7, I was able to start researching and understanding various issues related to my daily life. 
            I spent hours in front of that old monitor and I could feel the static electricity that raised the hair on my arms and shocked me when I touched a doorknob.
            Since then, I haven't done anything other than have fun using the computer, I've made a lot of drawings in paint, and I've visited a lot of random websites.</p>
        <p style="align: justify;">When I reached high school I had the merit of studying information technology in an integrated way, there I was able to see new possibilities 
            and better understand the fundamentals and applications of different programming languages, as well as computer assembly and maintenance. 
            Finally, I never stopped using the computer, much less wondering about how certain technologies work. 
            I believe that curiosity is the threshold between convenience and technological advancement. As long as there are people who 
            question themselves, there will always be new technologies and new opportunities.</p>
